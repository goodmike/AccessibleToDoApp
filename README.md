AccessibleToDoApp
=================

A version of the Ember.js MVC ToDo app that is modified for accessibility.

I'm taking the classic [TodoMVC toy project](http://todomvc.com/) that's often
used to demonstrate the use of a javascript application library in powering a
[single page applicaiton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)
and modifying it experimentally to improve its 
[Web accessibily](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_accessibility).

I'm using the [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) version from the Ember website's 
[Getting Started section](http://emberjs.com/guides/getting-started/).
